## Installation

### CocoaPods

FlagKits is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). 

To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'FlagKits'
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a simple, decentralized dependency manager for Cocoa.

Specify Eureka into your project's `Cartfile`:


```ogdl
github "LGKKTeam/FlagKits"
```

### Manually as Embedded Framework

* Clone FlagKits as a git [submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command from your project root git folder.

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/LGKKTeam/FlagKits.git
```

* Open FlagKits folder that was created by the previous git submodule command and drag the FlagKits.xcodeproj into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

* Select the FlagKits.xcodeproj in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches with your application deployment target.

* Select your project in the Xcode Navigation and then select your application target from the sidebar. Next select the "General" tab and click on the + button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.

* Select `FlagKits.framework` and we are done!
